 * @property matchNumbersLeniently Whether to treat all numeric types as the same. Useful for E.G. untyped deserialized data. Adds small extra step to most calls.
 * @property matchClassesQualnames Whether to treat classes as the same if they have the same qualifiedName. Useful for E.G. ignoring the invariant arrays representing vararg parameters. Adds small extra step to some calls.
 * @property resolveAmbiguousSpecificity Whether to try to resolve multiple ambiguous matching signatures by finding one that strictly subtypes all others.
