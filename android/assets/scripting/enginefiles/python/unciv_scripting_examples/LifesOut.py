"""
Demo and experimental mod for script-created and script-controlled GUI elements.

Adds combination Lights Out and Conways Game of Life minigame.


Call showPopup() to start playing.

Call injectAnywhere() to create a UI button to launch the game.


Due to performance and stability concerns, it's not recommended for a mod to write a lot of code like this.

But it can be done.
