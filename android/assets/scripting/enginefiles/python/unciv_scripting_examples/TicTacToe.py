"""
Demo and experimental mod for script-created and script-controlled GUI elements.

Adds Tic-Tac-Toe minigame. Winner gets whatever they're asking for from any currently open trade deal.


Call showPopup() to start playing.

Call injectAnywhere() to create a UI button to launch the game.


Due to performance and stability concerns, it's not recommended for a mod to write a lot of code like this.

But it can be done.
