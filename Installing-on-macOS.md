There is currently only one way to install UnCiv on macOS and that is by downloading the JAR file and running it with the help of Java 8. Here are the step by step instructions on how to do that:

1. If you don't already have Java 8 installed on your mac make sure you download it from the [official website](https://java.com/en/download/). Once you have downloaded the file open it and follow the instructions on screen.
2. Now that you have Java 8 installed it's time to download the latest UnCiv JAR. This can be done from the [releases](https://github.com/yairm210/UnCiv/releases) screen here on Github. Download the file called Unciv.jar.
3. After downloading Unciv.jar open Finder on your mac and go to the location where you chose to save the file. Right-click or Control-click the file and chose Open.
4. You will now be prompted with a window saying something similar to `macOS cannot verify the developer of "Unciv.jar". Are you sure you want to open it?` Press the Open button.
5. Congratulations, you have now installed UnCiv. You may want to add a shortcut to the desktop to be able to open the game more easily.

_(Sadly UnCiv dose not auto update when installing it using this method on macOS so you will need to download the latest Unciv.jar from Github every time you want to update the game.)_
