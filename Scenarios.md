At its core, a Scenario is simply a special type of saved game, where you can choose which of the civs you're going to play.

There are two separate, distinct parts to creating a scenario.

The first is creating the map - which is done in the Map Editor.

The second is fleshing out the civilizations themselves - the cities, units, techs, buildings etc - which is done by 'playing' the scenario civs in a special way as a regular game.

This feature is currently in Beta, so to activate it you need to activate (from inside an existing game) Menu > Options > Extended map editor

# Creating your map

If your scenario is going to use the basic Unciv ruleset, you don't need to do anything special here.

You can create your regular map and save it normally.

However, if you're going to use a special ruleset for this scenario and you need custom things on the map
 (custom units/improvements/terrains/resources),
or alternatively you want to place your starting units directly on the map instead of spawning them in-game,
you're going to have to work a little harder.

In the map editor, click Menu > Create Scenario to turn your map into a Scenario Map.

You can then place whatever units you want, and click 'save scenario map'.

# Creating your save

In the New Game screen, set up your game with the required civs, using your custom map,
 or if using a Scenario map just load it and the civs will already be configured.

If you're not using a Scenario map, you'll have to manually check the Scenario Editor checkbox - that will give us godmode powers in the game, to help us set up our scenario!

Be sure to change all Civs to Human controlled, so you'll be able to set them all up!

Once you've started your game, you'll be in 'godmode'. This means:

- Units can move endlessly
- You can purchase all buildings in cities and city tiles at 0 cost
- Double-clicking a tech in the tech screen will make the civ have that tech immediately
- Same with policies in the policy screen (enterable by clicking on the Culture part of the top bar)

Once you've finished setting up your game, save it as a regular save file with the word 'Scenario' at the end.

If you enter the 'New Game' screen again, you should see that there's a new map type - Scenario, from which you can load your game :)

# Other Notes

Scenario Map games start ONLY with the unit that are already on the map, so 'starting positions' and 'starting units' are irrelevant.

Scenarios have a new victory type - called, creatively, 'Scenario' - which changes the defeat condition to 'no units are left', and turns the game into 'fight to the last man'.
