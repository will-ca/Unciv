You can now create Scenarios in Unciv!

These are 'prebaked' games, which contain a specific map, ruleset and game parameters

This feature is currently in Beta, so to activate it you need to activate (from inside an existing game) Menu > Options > Extended map editor

In the map editor, click Menu > Create Scenario to turn your map into a Scenario!

Scenario games start ONLY with the unit that are already on the map, so 'starting positions' and 'starting units' are irrelevant.

Scenarios have a new victory type - called, creatively, 'Scenario' - which changes the defeat condition to 'no units are left', and turns the game into 'fight to the last man'.
